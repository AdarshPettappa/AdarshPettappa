# Hi Everyone! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Adarsh Pettappa, I am currently a junior, majoring in Computer Science at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, with a passion for Software Engineering, Full-Stack Development, and AI. Iâ€™ve worked on building robust, scalable systems, designing efficient APIs, and architecting full-stack applications that balance performance, maintainability, and user needs.

My recent experiences include optimizing backend functionality and deploying scalable systems at SocialTechLabs using Golang and AWS, as well as contributing to a Stock News Analyzer at Michigan Cantor, where I implemented web scraping and NLP techniques to predict market trends.
